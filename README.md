The intent of this project is to turn a HackRF (or other SDR board)
into a multi-band transceiver for use in amateur radio contests such as
the ARRL June VHF contest. At present it only supports CW.

At the moment, it depends on patches to hackrf and gr-osmosdr to add
support for transmit/receive switching:

* https://github.com/argilo/hackrf/tree/allow-tr-switching
* https://github.com/argilo/gr-osmosdr/tree/allow-tr-switching

## Usage

Install GNU Radio, and build hackrf and gr-osmosdr using the
"allow-tr-switching" branches indicated above. This can be accomplished
most easily using PyBOMBS.

The main transceiver application is vhf_transceiver.py, which can be
run from the command line. It ties together the receive and transmit
flow graphs (vhf_rx, vhf_tx) which are built with GNU Radio Companion.
The GUI is part of the receive flow graph.

To transmit CW, type your message into the "CW to send" box and press
enter. Once transmission is complete, the box will empty and the
waterfalls will start running again.

## Building a bootable USB flash drive

Install the dependencies:

* Packer https://www.packer.io/
* qemu-kvm
* apt-cacher-ng

Run the following:
```
PACKER_CACHE_DIR=/tmp packer build -only=qemu packer/base-xenial64.json
zcat build/2016-06-31-12-34/base-xenial64.raw.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdb bs=4M
```
Boot from the flash drive.
